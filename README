I use trello to simplify management of menus for my Kids together wiht their baby sitter.
I setup a public Trello board so that my kids baby sitter knows what dishes she has to prepare for them in the evening
The trello board is available here: : https://trello.com/b/llQLXb1E/menus 

I used a python script to generate grocery list based on menus planned for the week.

* the Trello Board has 1 column per day of the week, 1 columns for the "reserve" of all possible dishes, and a columns for grocery shopping
* when preparing menus for the week, I allocate dishes from "reserve" to weekday, and unflag ingredient I don't have in the fridge
* Then, running the Python script scans through all dishes selected for the week, and compile all missing ingredients into the "liste de course" card ("grocery list")
